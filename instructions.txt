run setup.sh
in console type "lsub" and check to see what all is already there
type "dmesg | grep tty" and see what is there
plug teensy into pi
do the lsub and dmesg again
if anything changes on lsusb then thats the teensy port
in the dronecode script put the port in the teensy_port variable at the top in the format '/dev/ttyUSB1' or whatever.
			it may say AMA0 or something
do the same checks for the usb radio
in the startup script change the mavlink from "--out=/dev/ttyUSB0,57600" to whatever usb it is
if I get to the xbee stuff do that same check and put the port in the xbee_port variable in the dronecode script

The startup script needs to say:

mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyAMA0 --baudrate 921600 --aircraft MyCopter --out=127.0.0.1:14550 --out=/dev/ttyUSB0 &
and the same script you already had for dronecode
